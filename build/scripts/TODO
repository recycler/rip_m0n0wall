critical areas
	kernel patches for a few things
		dummynet now in sys/netinet/ipfw/ip_dummynet.c  patch fails as dummynet is VERY different, ip_input.c patch is irrelevent until this is fixed if still required.

areas to investigate impact
    lnc kernel driver is gone from 8.1 etc
	
	
areas to improve
	support for Serial as ALIX and WRAP will be nanoBSD based on GENERIC kernel
	scripts to reverse the build scripts so you can do a clean build
