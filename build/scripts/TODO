critical areas
	ipfstat to be compiled, patched ok
	kernel patches for ipfilter and dummynet to be reviewed
	runfw, acpi and vlan removed from kernel for now as breaks build
	kernel doesn't like options		IPSTATE_SIZE=42859 or IPSTATE_MAX=30000 , so removed for now
	doesn't detect WAN interface for some reason on first boot
	ipfilter ipf command not working correctly, using active/inactive switch to workaround.
	all the kernel patches to be reviewed, several commented out.

areas to investigate impact
	Check removing ifconfig patches ok , basically does dhcp-pd work ? (randr etc)
	Check rtadvd patch for logging is good, looks fine

	syslinux build maybe reduced a fraction if not boot kmods are moved out of kernel into chroot for kldload after init/rc
	DHCP relay cannot start when DHCP server is running (even on different interfaces)
	ipfw supports redirect for ipv6 now, captiveportal should be updated
	
areas to improve
	wireless LAN country code selection ("ifconfig xxx list countries")
	revamp bridge support: use virtual interfaces, configured on Interfaces: Assign page (new tab
	syslinux build needs rework for symlinks not being supported on FAT32 (mac os supports symlinks on fat32 and there is a patch for linux)  .htpasswd, config.xml , etc/hosts and /etc/resolv.conf are broken.  It may be ok to just use them without the symlink	as modern flash drives can handle a lot of r/w before 'wearing out'
