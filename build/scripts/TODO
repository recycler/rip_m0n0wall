critical areas
	syslinux build needs rework for symlinks not being supported on FAT32 (mac os supports symlinks on fat32 and there is a patch 
		for linux)  .htpasswd, config.xml , etc/hosts and /etc/resolv.conf are broken.  It may be ok to just use them without the symlink
		as modern flash drives can handle a lot of r/w before 'wearing out'

areas to investigate impact
	syslinux build maybe reduced a fraction if not boot kmods are moved out of kernel into chroot for kldload after init/rc
    lnc kernel driver is gone from 8.1 etc
	DHCP relay cannot start when DHCP server is running (even on different interfaces)
	javascript around RA's is broken (when RA is not enabled, other options should be disabled)
	default ipv6 route still not being configured for wan ipv6=dhcp
	enable sysctl for hardware crypto for padlock and geode processor support that is now in m0n0wall kernel in vpn.inc
	
areas to improve
	avoid clobbering host system's libipsec
	make wireless LAN transmit power configurable
	show "11b/g" instead of only "11g" in GUI
	wireless LAN country code selection ("ifconfig xxx list countries")
	revamp bridge support: use virtual interfaces, configured on Interfaces: Assign page (new tab)
