Build m0n0wall on FreeBSD 8.2

Install freebsd 8.2 with developer features and login, su to root then.

Consider using cvsup to update the source tree to the latest
RELENG_8_2, and the ports collection to the latest version before
proceeding (see
http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/cvsup.html).

At this point, you can either

a) check out a repository (svn co http://svn.m0n0.ch/wall/branches/freebsd8),
   make any desired local changes, then cd into build/scripts and
   execute go.sh

   Note that any new files must be 'svn add'ed in order to appear in
   the exported build directory (but no need to commit yet)

b) Run the following commands to automatically get the latest version
   from the repository:

   # wget http://svn.m0n0.ch/wall/branches/freebsd8/build/scripts/go.sh
   # sh go.sh

This will give you a bash prompt where you should execute './doall.sh'  or execute each of the 5 shell scripts.

if all goes well, you will have generic iso and generic img in /usr/m0n0wall/build82/images/
