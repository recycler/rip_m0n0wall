Build m0n0wall on FreeBSD 8.2

Install freebsd 8.2 with developer features and login, su to root then.

Consider using cvsup to update the source tree to the latest
RELENG_8_2, and the ports collection to the latest version before
proceeding (see
http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/cvsup.html).

Install subversion:

# pkg_add -r subversion

Checkout the latest freebsd8 branch from the repository:

# svn co http://svn.m0n0.ch/wall/branches/freebsd8

Make any required changes/updates/fixes/... in the repository
(no need to commit yet), then cd into build/newbuild and start go.sh:

# cd build/newbuild
# sh go.sh

This will give you a bash prompt where you should execute './doall.sh'  or execute each of the 5 shell scripts.

if all goes well, you will have generic iso and generic img in /usr/m0n0wall/build82/images/
