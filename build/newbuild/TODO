critical areas
	kernel patches for a few things
		dummynet now in sys/netinet/ipfw/ip_dummynet.c  patch fails as dummynet is VERY different, ip_input.c patch is irrelevent until this is fixed if still required.

		

areas to investigate impact
    GEOM errors on boot, this is patched to remove this as was done with 4.11 kernel patch in 1.23 repo
    lnc kernel driver is gone from 8.1 etc
	trys to mount md0 not md0a, this is ok as scripts build for md0
	atareinit.c not found to compile in freebsd8 repo
	if_vlan.ko and if_tap.ko not to be found except in /boot/kernel
	
	
areas to improve
	support for Serial as ALIX and WRAP will be nanoBSD based on GENERIC kernel
	scripts to reverse the build scripts so you can do a clean build
