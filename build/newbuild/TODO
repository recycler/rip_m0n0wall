critical areas
	kernel patches for a few things
		dummynet now in sys/netinet/ipfw/ip_dummynet.c  patch fails as dummynet is VERY different, ip_input.c patch is irrelevent until this is fixed if still required.

		

areas to investigate impact
    GEOM errors on boot
    lnc kernel driver is gone from 8.1 etc
	trys to mount md0 not md0a, this is ok as scripts build for md0
	mklibs complains . file not found, this is because of links
	atareinit.c not found to compile in freebsd8 repo
	if_vlan.ko and if_tap.ko not to be found except in /boot/kernel
	disklabel doesn't have -s option anymore
	freebsd8 repo m0n0wall.files has bin/[:bin/test


areas to improve
	support for ALIX/WRAP GENERICwithSerial
	support for different image outputs
	scripts to reverse the build scripts so you can do a clean build
